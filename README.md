## TVmaze Agent (based on srob650's)

- Added support for Cast with character photo (fallback to actor photo)
- Added show's status (Running, Ended, Cancelled, etc) in content rating as TVmaze doesn't provide content rating (TV-MA, TV-14, etc)
- Renamed all instances of TVMaze to TVmaze as per TVmaze's brand guidelines
- Removed all instances of medium images as the original will always be there if the medium exist.
